// When you nest component into another componenet it becomes child-parant relationship
// ProtectedRoutes is a parant of Dashboard component, but it doesn't render anything bc we don't have a path
// Dashboard is a chikd, so in Protected Routes we should have outlet for chikd

// Outlet component --> creats space for child (like we did in NavBar app)
